Alright, so it's July now.

Big news from June is, we(Pied Piper) were second at AngelHack Delhi, which I belive is lot of surprise for me and my team at AH.

Phew, time flies by damn fast, I hope everyone enjoyed that 1 damn extra second you got, yesterday. I used mine to fix some errors of my Java code to create around 70 more.

As far as the updates go, I skipped over the IBM Bluemix hackathon, maybe I'm too tired but whatever.
Still no news of AngelHack in Udaipur and I'd "probably" be flying down to Bangalore for HackIndia, kudos to Kanishk and others for organizing thta.

So it's July 1st, I've got some ideas and plans in my mind that I plan on executing in the coming days and weeks, will update on them later.

And lots of travelling due this week, leaving for Jodhpur in 2 days and after that going for New Delhi in the coming week and then later as I said Bangalore.

A lot of things were going on in my mind, in the past lot of days, and there are some really "strong" changes in certain things but I think I'm able to sort myself out on this and probably start being productive again.
So with July, I'm going to bring an end to the super depressing and unproductive past weeks and really get going.

So, I'd be posting more on what I get into now later. As of now, only thing I did in the past couple of weeks is web tracking application, more on that later, it's open-sourced though and is extremely simple.

So, back again, not much yet, but hoping for a lot more and lot better later on.

That's all for now. I'll keep you updated.
