title: My first lazy post.

Hi. I'm Ritvik and I know you probably aren't going to read this anyway. But, I want to describe here first of all, this blog isn't for you. So, I don't think I should be calling it a blog, but again I'm too lazy to change that.

It's for me as a place to store some things so that I can refer to them in the future and not forget about them in some passage of time, because if I do, it would be a pain in some parts of the anatomy.

I'll probably add a gif here, but maybe later.

Probably too much sarcasm here, maybe it's one of my good days :P

So, if you find any thing useful here, good for you! Good luck.
